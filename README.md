# Unity-3D-Project

Part of my final project was orientated around creating an immersive racing environment for the user to experience the abilities of a motion platform with, 
in this case the use of a VR headset and Unity 3D.

The code within this repository determined how real life inputs from the motion platform movement, accelerator, brake and steering wheel were used in the unity environment.
Also included are scripts which governed the game's mechanics, such as lap times or a giving the vehicle the ability to shrink and enlarge at will.
